# Abstract 
Rancid Tomatillos is a react application that allows users to view a variety of movies and be able to see specific details such as Ratings, Description, Budget, Revenue, and trailers.

### Goals 
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using router

### Technologies used: 
 - React
 - Router
 - Cypress 
 - Webpack
 - Javascript 
 - HTML/CSS
 - Node Package Manager

## Project Reflection:
Rancid Tomatillos was both of our first official projects using React, so there we came across many wins and challenges along the way. 

- We struggled when beginning to implement Cypress, and had to do a lot of research on Cypress assertions and syntax before we could efficiently create and pass DOM tests. Specifically, we spent a lot of time learning to intercept network requests and use mock data for testing through fixtures.

- Managing asynchronous JS in React also created a challenge for us. Specifically fetching data for a specific movie when selected by a user, and storing that data in the App component state.

- Both of these challenges turned out to be wins for us, as we did a lot of independent research to learn to successfully implement these new technologies. We are particularly proud of our project's efficient routes, proper error handling, and comprehensive DOM testing.

## Future Additions:
We plan to continue working on our project moving forward, and hope to add trailers to our movie data page, fix some asynch rendering that gives page updates a bit of a lag, and deploy our project using Vercel!
